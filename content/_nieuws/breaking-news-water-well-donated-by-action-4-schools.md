Since its establishment in 2007, the Makombeh Foundation has provided primary school education to hundreds of children in rural Sierra Leone. Besides education, the foundation has provided teaching materials, uniforms, hygiene kits and radios for distance learning courses during COVID-19. Unfortunately children did not have access to water at school. Even when at home children had to walk a kilometer-long trip to the swamp to get water for the family. Luckily this will change next school year. The NGO [Action-4-Schools](http://www.action4schools.gi/) has come to the children's aid! A brand new water well has been dug, fully funded by the donors of this generous NGO. This significant improvement will allow the children to wash their hands, which helps stop the spread of infectious bacteria and viruses like COVID-19.
